# PosterDownloader
Webscraper for downloading official movie posters in the highest resolution available, using impawards.com as database

## Installation & Quick Usage

* End User:
    * Download the executable from ['releases'](https://github.com/FdelMazo/PosterDownloader/releases) the latest one and extract everything
    * After that, just start the PosterDownloader.exe (Windows) or write ./PosterDownloader in the terminal (Linux)

## Complete Features

## Developing

If you want to tweak and see the source code (written in Python 3.6):
* Just download from the repo page both "PosterDownloader.py" and "impawards.py" and start with 'python PosterDownloader.py'
* Keep in mind you need pip (default in Py3.4 onwards) and: requests, bs4 and lxml

Keep in mind, I don't encourage downloading several times in a short time span, as impawards tend to get angry when you request them so many images at once. 
Try to space out your downloads
